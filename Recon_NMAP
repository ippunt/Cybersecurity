[Script notes]
auth: Utilize credentials or bypass authentication on targethosts.
broadcast: Discover hosts not included on command line by broadcasting on local network.
brute: Attempt to guess passwords on target systems, for a
variety of protocols, including http, SNMP, IAX, MySQL, VNC,etc.
default: Scripts run automatically when -sC or -A are used.
discovery: Try to learn more information about target hoststhrough public sources of information, SNMP, directory services,and more.
dos: May cause denial of service conditions in target hosts.
exploit: Attempt to exploit target systems.
external: Interact with third-party systems not included in target list.
fuzzer: Send unexpected input in network protocol fields.
intrusive: May crash target, consume excessive resources, or otherwise impact target machines in a malicious fashion.
malware: Look for signs of malware infection on the target hosts.
safe: Designed not to impact target in a negative fashion.
version: Measure the version of software or protocol spoken
by target hosts.
vul: Measure whether target systems have a known vulnerability
