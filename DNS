1. Cache Snooping



1.
Create non-recursive queries. This will stop our DNS servers from querying forwarding servers. This will let us know what is in their cache. What 
valuable information would be in their cache? Well AV does specific queries for updates based on the AV that is in use. Same for Firewall updates and
switch/router updates for software or contacting licensing servers.
