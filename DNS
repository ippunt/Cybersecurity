1. Cache Snooping
2. Brute force
3. IP to host mapping



1.
Create non-recursive queries. This will stop our DNS servers from querying forwarding servers. This will let us know what is in their cache. What 
valuable information would be in their cache? Well AV does specific queries for updates based on the AV that is in use. Same for Firewall updates and
switch/router updates for software or contacting licensing servers. 

2. Query for servers based on known the domain base. 
fileserver.domain.local
we will probably want a hosts file for this. 
while read -r line; do; dig $line; done < vhosts.txt

3. Got a ticket for a specific IP address and you need to find which DNS maps to that IP?
Best quick shot is to get to cmd of the hosts >ipconfig /displaydns | findstr "127.0.0.1"; OR ipconfig /displaydns | findstr "hostname";  want to see if hostname
or IP is there whatever you have as things may change given the scenario.
