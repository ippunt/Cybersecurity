1. Ideas for Deception: from John strand, MITRE 
2. Beable to network anything push traffic how you choose.
3. IN DMZ should only look for IOC and should point to no where but where the FW can alert on. 
4. Risks
5. Decoys, Breakcrumbs

A good way to get all host traffic onto one docker container is with the use of proxy-arp and /32 routes.
 This will allow the gateway to respond to ARPs for the host on it's subnet and once the Arp is returned host traffic for hosts on the same subnet could   be sent anywhere.
You may have devices that do not support proxy arp but they likely support NAT. Nat is basically the same thing. NATing device Arps for an IP that does not belong to it but its policy it to NAT so has to respond to ARP and then NAT Policy and deliver. Can you NAT no NAT or just actually NAT to something that will alert. 

3.
DMZ Host -> IP in subnet but belonging to Virutal interface. Any Comms alert >> email or SIEM

4. Brake containment. Attempt to ensure no way to escape. 

5. 
DNS:
You may query DNS on a script feeding the cache so DNS non-recursive query only has limited information. 
You can place files with info you want to give them. 
Web:
Unlinked directories on website, would likely let you know there is suspicious behavior. 
Robots.txt controls web spiders. Put info in there for their hackers. Publicly exposed this is needed. Internal will likely tip off skilled hacker
they will likely know it is not publicly exposed. 
Links that redirects you to honeypot web. Of cloned sight. 
  Given FQDN and IPs your link might need to be relative to be good enough.
