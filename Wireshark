2)
Create – executed as create or open. Access something.
Read – read data from a resource 
Write – write data to a resource 
IOCTL – executes a filesystem  or device control across network. 

write     smb2.cmd ==9
create    smb2.cmd ==5     create may also be used when reading and modifying a file. 
ioctl     smb2.cmd ==11
read      smb2.cmd ==8

Smb2.tree =="\\\\fileserver\IPC$" 
Smb2.tree contains fileserver 
Smb2.tree matches fileserver 
Best use wireshar protocol analyzer contains and matches can be iffy 
Edit > Find packet> regex or string >      WORKED EXCELLENT.  

3)
tcp.flags and !( ip.dst == 2.2.2.2 ) and !(  ip.dst == 1.1.1.1 ) and !(ip.dst == 52.96.0.0/16 )
